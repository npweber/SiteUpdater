Site Updater
_______________________

This is a utility I use to automatically add an update to the feed of updates on my website, www.npwd.tech. It buffers the update.html page into a List of lines of the html and overwrites it with an edited buffer (current page + new update entry).

Very simple project, serves my systems. Feel free to look at it.

**Quick Fix: Site subdomain "ftp" was deleted. Now it connects using local IP.
