# SiteUpdater

This is a utility that automatically adds a blog update to a feed of updates at www.npwd.tech/updates. It allows for an update title and body to be passed as arguments, so an update entry can be generated and appended to the updates webpage. This served www.npwd.tech/updates before the site was taken down.
